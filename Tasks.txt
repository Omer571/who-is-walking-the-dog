            - When Trying to delete account, we get error, and after that error,
              we are also unable to update auth (e.g. Email)
            -Finish getting password for re authentication and try delete again
              (Solutions: re authenticated user then deleted via re authenticateUser() in SettingsHelpers)

    Create a helper file just for phoneNumber validation functions (Complete)

      Make Four functions called (Complete)
        isPhoneNumberValid,
        doesPhoneNumberAlreadyExistAsync,
        areValidPhoneNumbers,
        areDuplicateNumbersPresent, (in array)

      Register Screen (Complete)
        -isPhoneNumberValid (from utils)
        -doesPhoneNumberAlreadyExistAsync (Needs to be false)

      AddDogForm (Complete)
        -areValidPhoneNumbers
        -areDuplicateNumbersPresent

      SettingsPhoneNumber (Complete)
        -isPhoneNumberValid
        -doesPhoneNumberAlreadyExistAsync (must be false)

      DogSettingsFamilyMemberDialog (Complete)
        -isPhoneNumberValid
        -doesPhoneNumberAlreadyExistAsync (needs to be true, else send message that user must sign up first)

    When Updating Email, email could be duplicate. Original validator doesn't check
    for duplicated because the firebase.auth function does. But we may need to write new validator.
    (Solution: isEmailDuplicate function written)

    Found problem in phoneNumberValidator, now made into two separate functions
      1. Go back where phoneNumberValidator used and call both functions (CHECK)
      2. Finish second function and convert number to international (CHECK)
      3. Test
        - Register Screen (CHECK)
        - Add Family Members to Dogs (CHECK)
        - Settings Screen (CHECK)

      Fix keyboard and keyboard moving view in Register Screen
      (Solution: Make it so that in IntroBackground, if anything but input touched the keyboard will disappear)
      (Solution for keyboard moving in-front of phoneInput: (Solution: react-native-keyboard-aware-scroll-view))

      Possible Error, when subtracting user from inputs, user data may not delete
      AddDogFormTwo (fixed by making popDogFamilyMember)

      BIG LOGIC ERROR, alert thrown and dog not created is familyMember number already exists for
      another user, however, this is not how it should be. If user exists that's a good thing
      (Solution: Took out phoneNumberInCollectionAsync() function from AddGodFormTwo)

      Route doesn't even have a param attribute! Fix this
      (Solution: DONT pass navigation a parameter to a prop or function, use const navigation = useNavigation())

      Dogs Taking long time to be loading in SettingsScreen list, tried to fix with loading hook but failed
      (Solution: Fixed helper function getDogs to return whatever the dogRef.get() returns)

      Make New Dashboard

      May know way to have refresh work, have a state for refresh in both background and main component,
      main passes to background (OR USE: https://dev.to/muhammadawaisshaikh/how-to-get-an-updated-state-of-child-component-in-the-parent-component-using-the-callback-method-1i5)
      (Solution: Wasn't possible bc of {children} rather than solid component. Other solutions to complicated.)

      Using Task Manager And Backgrounded Fetch Test Fetching Capabilities
        Backgrounded Task First Fetch (FUNCTIONAL)
        Backgrounded Task Second Fetch (FUNCTIONAL)
        Backgrounded Task Third Fetch (FUNCTIONAL)
        (Solution, had to re-register task)
        Terminated Task Fetch (NOT WORKING BUT THIS IS UNAVOIDABLE)

      Fix DogConverter

      Improve current notification for request schedule change
      (button to unreserve day offered, send notification to other person denying request)
      (NOT POSSIBLE AS WELL)

      (Saturday will be special case where users encouraged to schedule days for pura week)

      Finish functionality for "REQUEST SCHEDULE CHANGE W/ OMER" (push notification)

      When we update one dogs schedule, it will not update other dogs schedule
      (Solution: Iterate through dog.members updating each one)

      Getting "Error: Objects are not valid as a React child (found: object with keys {}).
      If you meant to render a collection of children, use an array instead." When trying to load SingleDogDashboard
      (Solution: walker type was previously changed from type string to UserData, we needed to accommodate for that)

      Push Token missing for currentUser in dog.members (issue w/ passing user as param)
      (solution: needed to create new Navigation to accept new parameters, not be restricted by old ones))

      Delete Users, sign up again with yourself and dummy character (DONE)
      Test: adding dog, requesting schedule change, check if program is correctly
      finding existing and non existing users

      Dog isn't being saved to other existing users (Fixed, needed to change addDogToUserCollection)

      So it looks addDogScreen doesn't move to next screen like it's supposed to,
      also unhandled promise warning thrown, fix next time.
      (fixed - problem was customObject instead of js object being set())

      Instead of using member, what if we attached dogFamilyMember directly to user,
      would this be a problem since it's kind of cyclical? What if we just did user id?
      ALSO, if user doesn't exist with that phoneNumber, you are given the option to send
      them a text to sign up (via alert into our sms function we wrote)
      Steps:
        AddDogFormTwoHelpers needs to change and return list of existingMembers as UserData[]
        Change addDogToUserCollection and member type for dog.member (UserData)
        Look for other places this caused errors
      when family names entered, need to make sure that name doesn't exist in current dogs family
      (if we attach to user this isn't a problem)

      After throwing error in updateDogInCollection it still changes to unEditableTextInput (left alone)

      Time to remove dog and test, just have user dogs
      Turn dogs into subcollection of user (
        DONE AddDogForm(for add),
        DONE SingleDogDashboard(for update),
        DONE Dashboard (for get)
      )

    PROBLEM: Twilio doesn't seem to be compatible with react native
    uninstall rn-nodeify
    undo these: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36415157/twilio-react-native-unable-to-resolve-module-crypto
    uninstall twilio
    find new messenger = Expo.SMS

    Finish coding Notification and SMS sending to new dogs family members

    Set up notifications with iOS
    https://docs.expo.io/push-notifications/overview/

    Need to enforce phone number being added to members (may already be done)

    Possible Problems, Currently loads all dogs, what is we just want dogs for that user? (dog has user, user has dog)
    (Currently doesn't work, we may need to push the actual doc rather than DogObject, look into this more)
    (May need not even need dogs collection, check and think about!)

    Need to make sure unique key created for each dog, delete dogs and re-add

    Check if phoneNumber exists in DB

    InitialDogObject in AddDogForm NEEDS USER PHONE NUMBER

    Implement phone Number validator with libphonenumberjs
    Implement phone number input with react-native-phone-input

    Enforce number of days taken (have the Weekly Needs section updated and throw alerts when needs already met)

    update to git commit -m "SingleDogDashboard functionality complete and basic testing done"

    Have weekly needs update based on changed
      Test Cases:
        Reserve day first time someone else (CLEARED)
        Reserve day for self (CLEARED)
        Save changes for self (same dayType) (CLEARED)
        Save changes for self (different dayType) (CLEARED)
        Save changes for someone else (same dayType) (CLEARED)
        Save changes for someone else (different dayType) (CLEARED)
        Unreserve day (haven't implemented this yet ) (CLEARED)

    Switch all Twilio code to Expo.SMS

Future Tasks:
  On delete own account, go through everyones all dogs shared with other users and remove that family member
  Make List of Async functions in helpers and rename to async, then go through files and rename then
  How to use app instructions
  Need to Clean up dashboard, addDogFormTwo and singleDogDashboard
  made defaultDogObject.tsx, import it in needed files (ex) AddDogForm (may not need to any more: const user: User = {} as any)
  Switch alerts to react native paper dialog
  just pass dog object to card and extract info in card component (remove duplicate code with dog and dogName (several places))
  Add constants
  Add function to make array for keys of member memberInputs
  check to make sure proper number of member Inputs not succeeded with keys
  When fetching members, make sure the names don't go outside of cards (vertically and horizontally)
  put all types in types.tsx and use imports
  Make Error messages in Seperate file
  Currently, inAddDogForm, when multiple number errors, all alerts will get shown rather than one


  Old Notification Notes:
    Make dog hook instead of local dog and user
    (or call dog local dog)
    (this may take some time - decide if this is what you want to do while refactoring)

    Have User Stayed Logged In First
    Need to delete user.push_token on logout (only one push token per device) (later, for right now we are using this to test functionality)


    WEEK NEEDS TO RESET SUNDAY NIGHT (and that's when weekly notification sent out (8:00 Sunday night (already done)))
    So in Dashboard, have a use effect function called if (time == 8 pm on sunday) resetWeek() -> clears dog.schedule in DB and local dog
    (currently testing background-fetch w/ expo but no results)

    Find a way to stop scheduling background task duplicates

    Send notification when day the day before that the next day is not taken yet
    If ginger not taken out, send sad message at night

    How about once the day is registered for, that day's notification is canceled
    So we would have 7 daily notifications (7 for today reminder, and 7 for tomorrow, possibly 7 for sad notification)
    Once that day is registered for, that notification is turned off (both reminders)

    When Dog
    When Reserve day clicked, notification cancelled
    When unreserve clicked, notification on

    Problem is, current code only works when notification is get for whole group
    First lets test and make sure this it the case
    Start with testing with nothing registered
    Then test after someone else done

    For some reason dogs is an empty {} rather than an array of dogObjects in Dashboards?
    Problem is dogs isn't updated by the time it tries to render dog cards. I used loadingHooks
    to try to make the process work but it still fails. Reconsider complex push Notifications
