Give login functionality
Make Loading Screen

Current Task(s):

  update to git -m "SingleDogDashboard functionality complete and basic testing done"
  
  When Adding dog member, implement phone number reader and make surer (implement w/ twilio)
  Give functionality to "REQUEST SCHEDULE CHANGE W/ OMER" (sends text) (need user phone number at sign up)

  Allow to delete people from dog (or duplicate of yourself)/edit dog/Delete Dog itself
  Make cards bigger or get names to fit better (Gingeri.. || Ginger\nisNumberOne)

  Send notification when day the day before that the next day is not taken yet

  May know way to have refresh work, have a state for refresh in both background and main component,
  main passes to background (OR USE: https://dev.to/muhammadawaisshaikh/how-to-get-an-updated-state-of-child-component-in-the-parent-component-using-the-callback-method-1i5)



Current Problem(s):

  Enforce number of days taken (have the Weekly Needs section updated and throw alerts when needs already met)

  Currently, SingleDogDashboard Reserving days works perfectly as expected
    HOWEVER, dogHook is still being updated before setDogHook is called, even though we know it is only connected to shallow copies

  Child list error in Dashboard ONLY FIRST TIME RUNNING APP
  Warning when starting app about expo globals

  can't change text color of time picker, on reload it should be red, here is path to change color: (NOT WORKING)

        Save changes for someone else (different dayType) (CLEARED)
